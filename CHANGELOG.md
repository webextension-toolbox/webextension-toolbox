## [4.0.0] - 2021-06-22

### Changed

- All dependencies are now the latest and greatest - including Webpack, which was bumped from 2.6.1 to 5.40.0. As these dependency updates can introduce breaking changes for certain workflows, that's why the major version got bumped (v3.0.0 to v4.0.0)
- Edge is now Chromium - so it should get the polyfills automatically (kudos to @fapdash for this)
- All CI is now GitHub Actions
- Dependabot keeps us up to date
- Dropped Nodejs v10.x support, picked up v16.x
- Thanks to @dotproto we now have a cleaner README
